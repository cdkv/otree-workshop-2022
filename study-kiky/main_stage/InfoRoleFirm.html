    In part 2, we divide the firms in two groups. Group 1 has offered the private payment no more than 2 times in part 1 and Group 2 has offered the payment at least 3 times in part 1. Similarly, we divide the officials in a group that has accepted the payment no more than 2 times and a group that has accepted the payment at least 3 times in part 1. 
</p>
<p>
    For every decision in part 2, you will be associated with one group of the firms and one group of the officials. The groups will change for every decision and <b> you will be told which groups you are associated with </b>.
