<h3>
    <b> Round {{player.round_number}}</b>
</h3>

<p>
    It is important for you to know that all participants both in the role of officials and firms, have already participated in a similar decision situation in part 1. 
</p>

<p>
    Based on both officials' and firms' decisions in part 1, we formed a group composed of:
    <ul>
        <li><b>officials </b>who <b>accepted</b> the private payment from the firms 
    
    {{ if player.official_condition == "corrupt"}} <b>3 times or more out of 5 rounds</b>
    {{ else }} <b>2 times or less out of 5 rounds</b>
    {{ endif }}, and</li>
</ul>
    
 <ul>
     <li><b>firms</b> who <b>offered</b> the private payment to the officials 

    {{ if player.firm_condition == "corrupt"}} <b>3 times or more out of 5 rounds</b>
    {{ else }} <b>2 times or less out of 5 rounds</b>
    {{ endif }}</li>
</ul> 
    
   <p>
    From <b>this group</b>, we have randomly drawn the {{C.FIRM_ROLE}} associated with you.  
</p>

Now make your decision. Do you want to accept a private payment from the {{C.FIRM_ROLE}}?
