<h2>
    <b> Round {{player.round_number}}</b>
</h2>
<h3>Remember that: </h3>

<p>
     You have been randomly assigned to the role of <b>{{C.OFFICIAL_ROLE}}</b>. As a <b>{{C.OFFICIAL_ROLE}}</b>, you have to decide whether to <b>accept (or reject</b>) a private payment of 10 points from the {{C.FIRM_ROLE}} to make a deal that <b>improves your and firm's monetary earnings but decreases HIU's.</b> 
</p>

<p>
   Your earning in every decision will be partly dependent on the firm's decision that is randomly associated with you. Figure 1 contains a representation for possible earnings denoted in points.  
</p>

Now, make your decision. If the {{C.FIRM_ROLE}} offers you a private payment, would you accept the offer?
