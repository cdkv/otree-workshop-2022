        <p>
            In this stage of the experiment you will be asked to <b>revise</b> your previous decisions
            in case there are <b>inconsistencies</b> between your commitment to a principle in the first stage
            and your decisions in the second stage.
        </p>
        <p>
            In particular, we will explicitly present to you the <b>principle</b> and your chosen commitment,
            as well as the <b>decision</b> that is <b>inconsistent with your principle commitment</b>.
            This way, you can analyze the principle and your choices together.
            <br><br>
            You will then have the opportunity to <b>make changes</b> if you wish to do so.
            You might decide that you want to change your distribution choice to align with what the principle
            would have chosen for you. Or you might decide that the principle should not always be applied,
            so you can <i>"un-commit"</i> to the principle. <i>Note that you can also stick to your decisions in the
            earlier stages and not make any changes, i.e. you can leave both your commitment to the principle and
            your distribution choice as they were.</i>
            <br><br>
            Again, your decisions are <b>consequential</b>. Specifically, we will implement an income distribution
            for a group of 10 randomly drawn individuals based on your choices.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="wrapper textbox">
        <p>
            <b><u>This is how it works:</u></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the experiment, a <b>random mechanism</b> will determine which of your decisions is chosen
            for implementation. Each of the choices that will be presented to you during the revision stage
            have an <b>equal chance</b> to be chosen by the random mechanism.
            <br><br>
            Similar to stage one, there is a <b>pair of income distributions</b> associated with each principle.
            The two distributions differ from each other such that the <b>principle can be applied</b> in the way it
            was described to you. This means that it is possible to infer which distribution should be implemented
            based on the principle.
            <br><br>
            If the principle is chosen by the random mechanism to be relevant and you <b>commited</b> to the principle,
            then the <b>choice</b> between the two distributions is made <b>automatically based on the principle</b>,
            and this distribution will be implemented.
            <br><br>
            If the principle is chosen by the random mechanism to be relevant and you chose <b>not to commit</b>,
            then the pair will be presented to you to <b>make a decision manually</b>, and the distribution you choose
            will be implemented.
            <br><br>
            If the distribution choice is chosen by the random mechanism to be relevant and you chose <b>program A</b>
            in this pair, then program A from this pair will be implemented.
            <br><br>
            If the distribution choice is chosen by the random mechanism to be relevant and you chose <b>program B</b>
            in this pair, then program B from this pair will be implemented.
        </p>
