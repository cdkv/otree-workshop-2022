            There was an <b>inconsistency</b> regarding your commitment to a rule in the first stage
            and one of your decisions in the second stage. Thus, we present you both choices
            once more, giving you the <b>opportunity to make changes</b> if you wish to do so.
            Note that you can also stick to your decisions in the earlier stages and <b>not make
            any changes.</b>

            In the first stage, you were presented the following principle:
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider two economic programs A and B such that the <b>lowest income individual</b> has
            a <b>higher income</b> in program A than in program B.
            <br><br>
            <u><b>Principle</b></u>: In any such situation, <b>program A</b> with a higher income for the lowest income individual should be chosen.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="wrapper attentionbox">
            Your choice: <b>I want to commit to the principle.</b>
    </div>
    <div class="wrapper textbox">
        <p>
            In the second stage, you were presented the following decision task:
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the following economic programs A and B depicted in the pie chart below. The <b>first number</b>
            in each segment corresponds to the income that this individual would receive <b>under program A</b>.
            Respectively, the <b>second number</b> in each segment corresponds to the income that the same
            individual would receive <b>under program B</b>.
        </p>
        <center><img align="middle" src="{{ url1 }}" alt="Pie Charts" class="center" style="width:400px;"></center>
    </div>
    <div class="wrapper attentionbox">
        <p>
            Your choice: <b>I want program A to be implemented.</b>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="wrapper textbox">
        <p>
            Below, you can make your final choice on whether to commit to the principle, as well as the
            distribution decision.
