            In this stage of the experiment you will be asked to <b>choose</b> between
            <b>two different income distributions</b> where money is divided between <b>10
            randomly drawn individuals</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In particular, we will explicitly present to you a pair of income distributions, A and B,
            <i>in a pie chart</i>. Each <b>segment</b> of the pie chart represents one <b>individual</b>.
            The <b>first number</b> in each segment corresponds to the income that this individual would
            receive <b>under program A</b>. Respectively, the <b>second number</b> in each segment
            corresponds to the income that the same individual would receive <b>under program B</b>.
            <br><br>
            Your task is to <b>choose</b> either <b>program A or program B</b>, depending on which of the
            programs you would prefer to distribute money across other individuals (not involving yourself).
        </p>

            <b><u>Here is an example:</u></b>
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
            Consider the following economic programs A and B depicted in the pie chart below. The <b>first number</b>
            in each segment corresponds to the income that this individual would receive <b>under program A</b>.
            Respectively, the <b>second number</b> in each segment corresponds to the income that the same
            individual would receive <b>under program B</b>.
        </p>
        <center><img align="middle" src="{{ url1 }}" alt="Pie Charts" class="center" style="width:400px;"></center>
        <p>
            <br>
            You will then have <b>two options</b> to chose from. <br><br>
            The first option is <b>"I want program A to be implemented."</b>
            You should chose this option, if you think that distribution A is preferable out of the two distributions
            presented to you.
            <br><br>
            The second option is <b>"I want program B to be implemented."</b>
            You should chose this option, if you think that distribution B is preferable out of the two distributions
            presented to you.
            <br><br>
            Your distribution choices are <b>consequential</b>. Specifically, we will implement an income distribution
            for a group of 10 randomly drawn individuals based on your choices.
        </p>

            <b><u>This is how it works:</u></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the experiment, a <b>random mechanism</b> will determine which of your decisions is chosen
            for implementation. Each of the pairs that will be presented to you has an <b>equal chance</b>
            to be chosen.
            <br><br>
            If you chose <b>program A</b> in the randomly drawn pair of income distributions, then program A from
            this pair will be implemented.
            <br><br>
            If you chose <b>program B</b> in the randomly drawn pair of income distributions, then program B from
            this pair will be implemented.
