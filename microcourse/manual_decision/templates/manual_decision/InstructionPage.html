            Since you decided not to commit to a principle which may be relevant,
            you need to make the decision <b>manually</b>. You will be asked to <b>choose</b> between
            <b>two different income distributions</b> where money is divided between <b>10
            randomly drawn individuals</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The screen will look similar to what you already saw during the second stage of this experiment.
            In particular, we will explicitly present to you a pair of income distributions, A and B,
            <i>in a pie chart</i>. Each <b>segment</b> of the pie chart represents one <b>individual</b>.
            The <b>first number</b> in each segment corresponds to the income that this individual would
            receive <b>under program A</b>. Respectively, the <b>second number</b> in each segment
            corresponds to the income that the same individual would receive <b>under program B</b>.
            <br><br>
            Your task is to <b>choose</b> either <b>program A or program B</b>, depending on which of the
            programs you would prefer to distribute money across other individuals (not involving yourself).
            <br><br>
            Your distribution choice is <b>consequential</b>. Specifically, we will implement an income distribution
            for a group of 10 randomly drawn individuals based on your choice.

            Since you decided not to commit to a principle, you need to make the decision manually.
            <br><br>
            If you chose <b>program A</b> in the randomly drawn pair of income distributions, then program A from
            this pair will be implemented.
            <br><br>
            If you chose <b>program B</b> in the randomly drawn pair of income distributions, then program B from
            this pair will be implemented.
