        <p>
            In this stage of the experiment you will be asked to <b>revise</b> your previous decisions
            in case there are <b>inconsistencies</b> between your commitment to a rule in the first stage
            and your decisions in the second stage.
        </p>
        <p>
            In particular, we will explicitly present to you the <b>rule</b> and your chosen commitment,
            as well as the <b>decision</b> that is <b>inconsistent with your rule commitment</b>.
            This way, you can analyze the rule and your choices together.
            <br><br>
            You will then have the opportunity to <b>make changes</b> if you wish to do so.
            (1) You might decide that you want to change your distribution choice to align with what the rule
            would have chosen for you. (2) Or you might decide that the rule should not always be applied,
            so you can <i>withdraw</i> from the rule and uncommit. <i>(3) Note that you can also stick to your decisions
            in the earlier stages and not make any changes, i.e. you can leave both your commitment to the rule and
            your distribution choice as they were.</i>
            <br><br>
            Again, your decisions are <b>consequential</b>. Specifically, we will implement an income distribution
            for a group of 10 randomly drawn individuals based on your choices.
        </p>

    <div class="wrapper textbox">
        <p>
            <b><u>This is how it works:</u></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the experiment, a <b>random mechanism</b> will determine which of your decisions is chosen
            for implementation. Each decision in this stage can be chosen for implementation. You should <b>always
            choose</b> the option that you <b>actually prefer</b>, because this is the only way to increase the chance
            that your preferred option is implemented.
            <br><br>
            Similar to stage one, there is some <b>pair of income distributions</b> associated with each rule (not
            necessarily the same pair which you are given an option to revise).
            The two distributions differ from each other such that the <b>rule can be applied</b> in the way it
            was described to you. This means that it is possible to infer which distribution should be implemented
            based on the rule.
            <br><br>
            If the rule choice is picked by the random mechanism to be relevant and you are <b>commited</b> to the rule,
            then the <b>choice</b> in that pair of distributions (not necessarily the same pair which you are given an
            option to revise) is made <b>automatically based on the rule</b>, and this distribution will be implemented.
            <br><br>
            If the rule choice is picked by the random mechanism to be relevant and you are <b>not commited</b> to the rule,
            then the pair will be presented to you to <b>make a decision manually</b>, and the distribution you choose
            will be implemented.
            <br><br>
            If the distribution choice is picked by the random mechanism to be relevant, then the payoffs are determined
            by the distribution choice you make.
            If you choose <b>program A</b> in this pair, then program B from this pair will be implemented.
            If you choose <b>program B</b> in this pair, then program B from this pair will be implemented.
        </p>
